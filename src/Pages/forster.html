                <p style="font-family: Verdana">I’ve been reading a book titled The AI Mirror by Shannon Vallor, a
                    leading AI ethicist, and chanced upon this hauntingly beautiful quote from a short story by E.M.
                    Forster titled “The Machine Stops”:
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">“Man, the flower of all flesh, the noblest of all creatures visible, man
                    who had once made god in his image, and had mirrored his strength on the constellations, beautiful
                    naked man was dying, strangled in the garments that he had woven.”
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">Forster envisions a dystopian future where humans are forced to live in
                    underground pods by a superintelligent computer called ‘The Machine’. It is the sole dictator of all
                    civilizations, and the only medium by which humans see and speak to each other. With the prevalence
                    of and sometimes reliance on online modes of communication, Forster’s picture may not be as far from
                    the truth as it may initially appear.

                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">The future is inherently vague. Precisely because it is unpredictable,
                    we may mold it in any shape we see fit. The imagination may operate at its fullest capacities. Ideas
                    of the imagination may not always be right, but it is certainly because of the imagination that
                    these predictions of technological reliance by Forster were materialized in the first place back in
                    1909. More than a century ago, he lived in an era with none of the technology we are so familiar
                    with.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">This brings me to my main point: AI Ethics is often praised as a new
                    field with refreshingly novel problems, but although the technologies may be new, the thoughts
                    behind the field are not. People have been projecting humanity onto various entities since the dawn
                    of time. Even natural forces such as thunder and wind were impersonated into deities by many
                    cultures such as the Greek and Chinese. Many of the risks posed by AI (world domination, posing
                    threats to human society) can be similarly attributed to the automatons of the ancients.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">In Homer’s epics, automatons fully made of bronze forged by Daedalus,
                    the ancestor of sculptors, possessed human capabilities and movements. The influential (huge
                    understatement) philosopher Socrates, whose father was a sculptor and himself trained to be a
                    sculptor, evokes the name of Daedalus’ swift automatons in the dialogue Euthyphro to emphasize the
                    evasiveness of ideas when one tries to verbalize them. The act of creating artificial intelligence
                    is therefore as intimate with philosophy as possible.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">This embodiment is a way for humans to understand the world. After all,
                    we see the world through human eyes, easily susceptible to anthropomorphizing things. The imagery
                    and symbolism we apply to the AI of today are fundamentally inseparable from the cultural tropes of
                    the past.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">Technofuturism, what I take to be the largely speculative project of
                    constructing future societies and their technological advancements in literature, is thus a special
                    type of history-telling which attempts to disguise itself in originality.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">But, as man strangles himself in his silicon garments, so did Icarus,
                    son of Daedalus, kill himself with his artificial wings. It was his own hubris which led him to fly
                    too close to the blazing sun. AI cannot magically destroy the world in its current state. We must do
                    something wrong first.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">Mythical technologies, whether it be wings or automata, have a long
                    cultural legacy and serve as valuable warnings. As Iocasta in Oedipus Rex laments that the greatest
                    tragedies are self-made, we must seek self-knowledge as AIs are ultimately mirrors of humanity. Only
                    with a comprehensive understanding of the rich legacies of literature and philosophy can we more
                    readily deal with questions in AI Ethics and uncover the origins of our intuitions.
