                <p style="font-family: Verdana">There are many theories, some more far-fetched than others. I’ve
                    recently been thinking about the value of obscure theories which diverge from the mainstream. On one
                    hand, they expose our flaws and inadequacies (i.e. flat earth theory), but on the other, they may
                    pick out specific intuitions and observations we have.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">One example of the latter is with panpsychism, which ascribes mental
                    properties, or ‘souls’, to all things, not just living ones. There is just something so mysterious
                    and ineffable about the universe, which cannot be reduced to the physical or material (I highly
                    recommend taking a look at <a
                        href='https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&context=bts'
                        style="color: #000">this article</a> by Michael Fox and the <a
                        href='https://www.ccel.org/d/dostoevsky/karamozov/htm/book07/chapter04.html'
                        style="color: #000">last part</a> of the Cana of Galilee
                    chapter in Dostoevsky’s Brothers Karamazov).
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">In discussing theories off the beaten path, I want to introduce the
                    Rawlsian idea of reasonable pluralism in political philosophy but with a metaphysical spin. There
                    are so many philosophical theories which people affirm which are irreconcilable, although
                    reasonable, that there is no practical way to eliminate this diversity.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">I don’t think this is a bad thing however.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">For example, moral debates will never stop happening. I am confident in
                    that fact. Moral philosophy will not reach a state in the future such that everything is said and
                    done, which I refer to as the state of final determination. One huge issue with AI alignment is what
                    values are we even aligning the AI with? Humans can’t even agree among themselves which moral theory
                    is best, and with the current state of human values, do we really want to align AI with those values
                    (the ones causing war, genocide, and destruction to this day)?
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">Like Rawls, I take reasonable pluralism to be an illuminating idea. It
                    is necessary to remind ourselves that doctrines which purport to be comprehensive such as
                    utilitarianism or virtue ethics are themselves flawed and incomplete in many ways. These are not to
                    say that they may be helpful heuristics. They are tools or references, nothing more.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">Take the way that philosophers do first order deductive logic. 19th
                    century logical notation, used by Frege for example, appeared much differently than modern day
                    notation:
                </p>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="../Images/frege.png">
                </div>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">There’s even more wild forms of logic such as paraconsistent logic and
                    dialetheism (search the Liar’s Paradox). The joke is that everyone does logic one way but the
                    Australians.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">This is healthy, however, to have a whole host of reasonable viewpoints
                    instead of one viewpoint which dominates the field. As G.A. Cohen notes, one of the reasons why
                    French philosophy has so much bullshit is because Paris holds an intellectual hegemony over all the
                    French-speaking world. Meanwhile, in analytic philosophy (which aims for clarity and precision),
                    there is no one area which dominates English philosophy, as there are major intellectual centers not
                    only on the East and West Coasts of the USA but also across the globe in Canada, England, and
                    Australia. This helps to keep English philosophers in check, as no one location has dominance. They
                    must be more mindful.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">Thus, theories off the beaten path are valuable in many ways. The most
                    obvious is that they explore untreaded or less popular alternatives which may hold promising
                    answers. The second is that they promote a healthy culture of intellectual pluralism which forces
                    philosophy to be more rigorous. And finally, they resist the final determination of ideas, which is
                    dogmatism in its ugly form. But, we must also not forget that these theories ought to be reasonably
                    founded and argued in good faith, as that is what I am assuming as does Rawls in his framework of
                    reasonable pluralism.
