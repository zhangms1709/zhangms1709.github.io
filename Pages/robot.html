                <p style="font-family: Verdana">Plato is famous, perhaps notorious, for his idea of the philosopher
                    king. Undergoing decades of physical, mental, and mathematical training, they are the best and sole
                    candidates to rule the city. A new idea inspired by this is that of the robot king. Technology has
                    been increasingly integrated within the political and legal domains. Models are widely used by
                    police departments across the country to assess risk of flight (whether to provide bail) and risk of
                    the defendant committing another crime.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">Although technology are not the sole rule makers in any government,
                    perhaps they are not that far away. Today, more than any other point in the course of human
                    civilization, we are all influenced by the technology we use. We read the news on our phones,
                    communicate with others via messaging technology, and even learn and work online. The pandemic only
                    accelerated these changes.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">Thus, our political leaders are in no doubt influenced by the technology
                    which they use on a day to day basis as well as the culture surrounding it. We are probably then
                    grossly underestimating the extent to which our opinions and political values (not to say views) are
                    subtly (or not) influenced by technology.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">This is still far away from robot kings, but it is a starting step. If
                    we are to say that robots in rule, I do not see the need for robots to be explicitly in rule. For
                    example, some might say that whoever is president of the United States is inconsequential, as those
                    who have the real power and influence are not in that single position. It may then be concluded that
                    rulership is not only explicit. There is an even stronger form of government which is implicit and
                    hidden, which although not public roles, play an equally significant part in the governmental
                    process.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">The robot kings perhaps already exist in a very crude, bare-bones form.
                    If one recalls large language models such as Gemini or ChatGPT, they provide all sorts of commentary
                    and resources. Although they are trained by humans, and thus not completely external or alien from
                    ourselves, they produce outputs which are grounded in math. The more far-reaching impact these
                    technologies have, the more our thinking will be influenced and mechanicalized. Some schools in the
                    UK have already introduced AI tutors to educate students, and although this may seem harmless at
                    first, if implemented on a large scale, teaching would be rendered human-less. It may thus be
                    anticipated that those educated by robots lack the same dispositions and attitudes which would have
                    been fostered within a human-ran classroom.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">Part of why I put this in vague terms is because I am still uncertain as
                    to what extent our politics will be influenced by technology. Certainly the spread of misinformation
                    has become easier than ever with deepfakes and ability to produce speech mimicking any human being
                    on earth. But, that is just the surface level. One what should really be worried about is that
                    educational, more long-term aspect, as that is formative to the new generation.
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">One part of technology that has certainly influenced the very fabric and
                    core of society (and perhaps reality) is social media. Its ability to warp reality for any
                    generation (although the younger generation, especially female teenagers are more susceptible) is
                    striking. Fueled by a constant anxiety of missing out and imposter syndrome, people cultivate fake
                    and curated profiles of themselves online. They equate that with their identity, value, and reality.
                    They see not the world through their own eyes, but through the eyes of others (and the judgements of
                    others).
                </p>

                <p style="font-family: Verdana">Certainly this technology is exclusively designed and created by humans,
                    but after the point of creation, it takes on a life of its own. It doesnâ€™t matter if robots can
                    think, move, possess physical bodies, or talk to us. Perhaps technology is already influencing our
                    politics and worldviews, to the point that we are being governed by the very products we created.
                    This governance, however, is invisible, the most powerful political form.
